# Correspondence_Analysis

Correspondence Analysis (CA) is a statistical method used to analyze the relationships between categorical variables in a contingency table. It is a data visualization technique that helps to explore and understand the associations between variables and highlights patterns in the data.

Key points about Correspondence Analysis:

Contingency Table: Correspondence Analysis is typically applied to contingency tables, which are cross-tabulations of categorical variables. Each cell in the table represents the count or frequency of occurrences of specific combinations of categories.

Objective: The main objective of Correspondence Analysis is to represent the associations between rows and columns of the contingency table in a lower-dimensional space, usually a two-dimensional plot, while preserving the relationships between the variables.

Eigenvalue Decomposition: Correspondence Analysis involves decomposing the original contingency table using singular value decomposition (SVD) to obtain the coordinates of the rows and columns in the new lower-dimensional space. This helps in visualizing the patterns and relationships in the data.

Interpretation: Points representing rows and columns are plotted in the two-dimensional space, and the distance between these points reflects the degree of association between categories. Points that are close together are more similar in terms of their associations, while points that are far apart are dissimilar.

Visualization: The two-dimensional plot created through Correspondence Analysis provides insights into the relationships and patterns between the categorical variables. It helps to identify clusters, trends, and associations in the data.
